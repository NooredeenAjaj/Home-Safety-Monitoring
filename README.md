# overview
The project pertains to home security monitoring. The objective is achieved through three different sensors: temperature, light, and magnetic field sensors. The data received from these sensors will be visualized using Adafruit.
This is a project designed for beginners and, following this tutorial, the estimated time required for completion is between 3 to 5 hours.


# Objective
The aim of this project is to enhance home security by employing a variety of sensors to gather real-time data, which could potentially be lifesaving. Beyond safety, this project could also be utilized for temperature and light monitoring, as well as energy conservation. By providing information on optimal times to switch off lights and heating systems, it fosters efficient energy usage.

#Material


For this project, we will be using the microcontroller Raspberry Pi Pico WH. It offers numerous digital and analog inputs and outputs, and is equipped with a 2.4GHz wireless interface. For detailed information about the Pico W, refer to the datasheet.

For temperature and humidity measurement, we have selected the DHT11 Humidity & Temperature Sensor, which offers digital output. Its measurement range is sufficient for this project, with temperature accuracy from -20°C to 50°C, and humidity from 20% to 90% RH.

Additionally, we will require a breadboard and several jumpers to facilitate connections. A micro-USB cable is also necessary for connection to our computer, which will also function as our power source.



Explain all material that is needed. All sensors, where you bought them and their specifications. Please also provide pictures of what you have bought and what you are using.
