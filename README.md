# overview
The project pertains to home security monitoring. The objective is achieved through three different sensors: temperature, light, and magnetic field sensors. The data received from these sensors will be visualized using Adafruit.
This is a project designed for beginners and, following this tutorial, the estimated time required for completion is between 3 to 5 hours.


# Objective
The aim of this project is to enhance home security by employing a variety of sensors to gather real-time data, which could potentially be lifesaving. Beyond safety, this project could also be utilized for temperature and light monitoring, as well as energy conservation. By providing information on optimal times to switch off lights and heating systems, it fosters efficient energy usage
