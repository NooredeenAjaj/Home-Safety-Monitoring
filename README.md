# overview
The project pertains to home security monitoring. The objective is achieved through three different sensors: temperature, light, and magnetic field sensors. The data received from these sensors will be visualized using Adafruit.
This is a project designed for beginners and, following this tutorial, the estimated time required for completion is between 3 to 5 hours.


# Objective
The aim of this project is to enhance home security by employing a variety of sensors to gather real-time data, which could potentially be lifesaving. Beyond safety, this project could also be utilized for temperature and light monitoring, as well as energy conservation. By providing information on optimal times to switch off lights and heating systems, it fosters efficient energy usage.

# Material


For this project,  the microcontroller Raspberry Pi Pico WH is used . It offers numerous digital and analog inputs and outputs, and is equipped with a 2.4GHz wireless interface. For more info see [datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-w-datasheet.pdf) .

The temperature measurement, the Temperatursensor NTC was choosen, The reason is that it has a larger range. Its measurement range is sufficient for this project, with temperature accuracy from -55°C to +125°C.see [datasheet](https://www.electrokit.com/uploads/productfile/41015/41015732_-_Analog_Temperature_Sensor.pdf). 


in order to measure the lighting in the room , we will use a Light sensor. It can be used as a simple light sensor where the amount of light determines the output signal. It can be directly connected to an analog input on a microcontroller. see [datasheet](https://www.electrokit.com/uploads/productfile/41015/41015727_-_Photoresistor_Module.pdf)

A Hall effect sensor for detecting magnetism. The sensor's output remains high as long as it is not in proximity to a magnet, and it pulls the output low when exposed to a magnetic field above a certain threshold. this sensor will  be placed nere by the door with a  magnet. see [datasheet](https://www.electrokit.com/uploads/productfile/41015/41015730_A314x-Datasheet.pdf) and the [user guide](https://www.electrokit.com/uploads/productfile/41015/41015730_-_Digital_Halleffect_Sensor.pdf). 


Additionally, we will require a breadboard and several jumpers to facilitate connections. A micro-USB cable is also necessary for connection to our computer, which will also function as our power source.
